## 🌐 Overview

**VAS (Virtual Audio Scape)** is a web platform for mixing and layering 
real-world sounds into immersive audio environments, with built-in 
video sync powered by FFmpeg.

Built for independent creators who want professional-quality soundscapes 
without expensive tools or a steep learning curve.

The backend runs on Node.js + Express, with MySQL handling users, 
sound packs, and purchase history. The most relevant technical 
decision here was running FFmpeg server-side: when a user syncs 
a soundscape to a video, Express pipes the files through FFmpeg 
and returns the rendered output, keeping quality consistent 
regardless of the client's device.

The database schema follows an ownership model - users own packs, 
packs contain tracks - designed to support individual or bundled 
purchases down the line.
